Always show text-entry location in Nautilus/Files

The standard Files toolbar shows a button bar interface for path navigation. 
To enter path locations using the keyboard, you must expose the location text-entry field. 
This is done by pressing Ctrl+l

To make the location text-entry field always present, use gsettings as shown below: 
gsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences always-use-location-entry true

Note: After changing this setting, you will not be able to expose the button bar. Only when the setting is false can both forms of location navigation be employed.
